# Nasko's Restaurant

The Nasko's Restaurant is a web Application app that I have made to test and practice Some of the technologies,
        and tools that I've learned At <a href="http://telerikacademy.com">Telerik Academy</a> .
        The App represents a Restaurant in which you can make and organize reservations Apply for a job,
        submit or upload a Resume Form. You can also browse and send feedbacks, after you create a
        simple profile account. I have removed the default password requirement so the people can
        create account easily to test functionality of the application.
        There is a cool hidden feature on the Reservation and My Reservation page. There is a
        little close Button on the top of the page right after Nasko's address headline. When
        someone hits that button. Reservation form closes and Joke page load 3 random jokes with JQuery.
        The project looks well on most of the devices.
